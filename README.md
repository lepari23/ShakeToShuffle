# ShakeToShuffle
A web-based interactive shuffling tool that lets users enter a list of options, then trigger a randomized reordering â€“ either by tapping a button or simply shaking their smartphone. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, ShakeToShuffle is deployable on GitHub Pages and leverages the DeviceMotion API for a fun, native feel.
